            <p>Welcome to my first personal website I've ever made in my entire life!&#10024ü•≥üéâ<br>
                <br>
                I just learned about how to make website a while ago.<br>
                <br>
                There might be typos here and there or some inconsistency in the design, and that's all the more reason why I have to keep learning.üòÅ<br>
                <br>
                I'll keep you guys updated with more projects in the incoming months!<br>
                <br>
                Here I attached project(s) I made in the past months.<br>
                <br>
                Feel free to take a peek! ;)

                        <h2>- Tea Cozy</h2>
                        <p>A website made for promoting a Tea Cafe. This one is not real, I made this from the assignment given by the online course I currently enroll. Took me about 2 days to finish it.</p>
